# deutsch-learning
 A website to help me study German.
 Most of the resources are found through the r/German subreddit. 
 I take no credit for the material on this website.
 I am just organizing it in a way that helps me learn while also working on my web-development skills.


Road Map:
Gather Resources to place starting with A1.
Organize resources so it's easy to find and work through.
Eventually break the resources down to a day by day lesson style.

Once A1 is complete, move on to other levels of study.

Things to do in the far future:
Create a sign in page so people can track their progress.
Once sign in is possible make it so people can check off days of study and update the buttons to reflect completed content.
